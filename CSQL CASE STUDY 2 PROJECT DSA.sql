-----Question 11....

---If the delivery truck is the most economical but the slowest shipping method and 
---Express Air is the fastest but the most expensive one, do you think the company 
---appropriately spent shipping costs based on the Order Priority? (Explain your answer)

WHERE Ship_Mode IN ('Express Air', 'Delivery Truck')  
GROUP BY Order_Priority, Ship_Mode  
ORDER BY Ship_Mode, Total_Cost DESC

----Answer: Based on Order Priority				Ship Mode					Total Cost

-----		Low									Delivery Truck				$1,659.14
-----		High								Delivery Truck				$1,274.98
-----		Not	Specified						Delivery Truck				$1,040.76
-----		Medium								Delivery Truck				$925.25
-----		Critical							Delivery Truck				$829.01
-----		Low									Express Air					$289.95
-----		Not	Specified						Express Air					$257.40
-----		Critical							Express Air					$195.19
-----		Medium								Express Air					$167.27
-----		High								Express Air					$108.92

------Was shipping cost appropriately spent based on Order Priority?

----a- Appropriate spending depends on matching high-priority orders with fast (Express Air) shipping and low-priority orders with economical (Delivery Truck) methods.
----b- If there are mismatches (e.g., urgent items shipped via Delivery Truck), the spending is inappropriate.
----c- A proper audit of the data would confirm alignment.
